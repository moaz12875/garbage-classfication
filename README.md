# garbage-classfication
This project classifies waste into 10 categories: cardboard, battery, metal, paper, plastic, shoes, trash, biological, clothes, and glass. Using image recognition, the model improves waste sorting and recycling efficiency, reducing environmental impact and supporting sustainable waste management.
